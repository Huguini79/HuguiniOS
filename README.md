This operating system was made by Huguini79 in 3 months, this operating system is from scratch.

The operating system(including IDT interrumptions, disk driver, FAT16, gdt descriptor, kheap, string, pparser, paging, memory heap etc, I/O ports, ELF loader, AND A SHELL), it's wrote in C and Assembly, and it's being constantly updated.

The bin folder is where the compiled version of the operating system resides(you can emulate with QEMU the os.bin or HuguiniOS.img file), the build folder is where the object files of the HuguiniOS source code resides, and the src folder is where the HuguiniOS source code resides, you can see the files in Assembly or in C.

I hope you enjoy my operating system and if you want, you can do your own version of HuguiniOS. !IT'S OPEN SOURCE!

For anyone who is interested, I learned how to make my operating system using the book Developing a multi-thread kernel from scratch of McCarthy
